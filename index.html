        full-time employement, contracts, and freelance work.  Take a look at my portfolio, then
        <a href="mailto:zachbowman0@gmail.com">contact me</a> and we'll to talk about working on your next project.

    <div class = "stripe">About Me</div>

    Designing and developing innovative games has been a passion of mine since 1995.  I majored in computer science at Millersville
    University, and I've continued to constantly learn new tools, skills, and engines since.  In 2006, I co-founded Nightmare Games
    (now Cricketheads) with my best friend and long-time creative partner. I've been hard at work creating the next generation of
    innovative games since.<br>
    <br>
    I started working with the web and HTML in the late 90's to support my other projects, but over time, web design and development
    have become an entirely new pursuit for me.  Since those early pages, I've learned CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and a host of other cool
    technologies.  I intend to bridge the gap between these two worlds by producing awe-inspiring web games.<br>
    <br>
    The projects I'm creating today aren't just self-contained ideas.  These are the foundations and building blocks of larger,
    more complex systems I've planned for the future.
    My goal is to create unique and immersive worlds to explore and then bring as many people into those worlds as possible.<br>

        This was an idea for a supercharged, scrabble-like spinoff game I pitched, and then assembled a team to help develop.  Working together,
        we used jQuery UI, a dictionary API, and data binding we wrote ourselves to make an html web page into a fully interactive board
        game (using no game engines or canvas tags).  It supports up to four players, and features multiple board shapes, dictionary
        definitions, and a fully functional validation and scoring system.

        This browser-based web application uses the Google Maps and Google places APIs to plot a driving route.  Then, it shows the
        user places of interest, restaraunts, gas, and other activities on that path.  I helped design and program this using
        Javascript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML as part of a four-person team.

        I programmed this puzzle game in XNA Game Studio using C#, and ported it to Windows, Xbox 360, and Windows Phone 7.
        All of the design, programming, graphics, sound, and music elements were created by me.  It's currently available
        for PC as a free download, with a 3D sequel being planned for the Unity engine.

        Boxland is an action / puzzle / adventure game project on which I'm the lead designer and programmer.
        The game takes inspiration from classic Nintendo games like Zelda, Metroid and Megaman, but with
        high-resolution graphics, refreshing twists and modern gameplay features.  Boxland, inc. will be
        initially available for the PC through Steam, with potential ports for Xbox Live, PSN and iOS.

        Between larger projects, I'm currently developing a series of browser-based minigames in HTML5 and Javascript.
        The goal is to start small and push the limits of Javascript in terms of graphics, gameplay complexity and
        user interface to test how far it can take us.  Our first minigame is near completion, with several more planned,
        including a port of the original Blockhead.
