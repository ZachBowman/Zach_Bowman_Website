  Gameplay is the overall feel and flow of the game.  It determines what genres
  the game lifts inspiration from as well as the pacing and style.<br>

    My current project, Boxland, is a hybrid puzzle / action / adventure game.  The
    player freely explores the labyrinth of a large factory searching for keys to unlock
    new areas.  Players will need to be both clever and creative to collect keys since
    most puzzles will have multiple solutions.  At the same time they will also have to
    battle the game's enemies using melee and projectile weapons.</font>

    Blockhead is a two-dimensional puzzle game in the vein of Kirbee's Avalanche or
    Dr. Mario.  One of the important gameplay decisions I made was to include an
    optional countdown timer, which can change the game into either a methodical,
    thinking game or an anxious race based on the player's preference.

  Sometimes it's the little things that elevate a good game to great game status.
  The specific rules and systems that govern a game's experience often contribute
  the most to what makes it addictive and unique.

    In Boxland, the player gains different superpowers granted by various magical
    sweatshirts, which he uses to move objects and solve puzzles.  The shirts are
    also equipped with specialized attack moves for combat situations.  The different
    types of boxes and machines in the game respond differently to both the player
    and the environment, creating the possibility for interesting interactions and
    complex puzzles.

    Blockhead is the first puzzle game to use color blending as a primary tool.  The
    goal is to get three of the same colored blocks in a row, but the player can also
    change a block's color.  If a red block is placed touching a blue block, for
    example, the blue block turns purple.  This creates the possibility for chains
    of block destruction and block avalanches.

    The story and characters are some of the most important elements in medium to
    large-sized games.  I've been writing creative fiction both in and out
    of games for almost twenty years.  I specialize in science-fiction, horror, and
    cartoon humor, but I've also worked on comic books, black comedy, and folk tales.
