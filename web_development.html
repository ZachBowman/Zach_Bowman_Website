    From simple HTML to complex frameworks and engines, I've been steadily expanding my web programming arsenal the past few years.
    I've recently completed a full-stack Javascript program at Codefellows in Seattle, covering everything from Node.js to jQuery.<br>

        <span class = "title">Word Wars</span><br>
        <br>
        This was an idea for a supercharged, scrabble-like spinoff game I pitched, and then assembled a team to help develop.  Working together,
        we used jQuery UI, a dictionary API, and data binding we wrote ourselves to make an html web page into a fully interactive board
        game (using no game engines or canvas tags).  It supports up to four players, and features multiple board shapes, dictionary
        definitions, and a fully functional validation and scoring system.

        This browser-based web application uses the Google Maps and Google places APIs to plot a driving route.  Then, it shows the
        user places of interest, restaraunts, gas, and other activities on that path.  I helped design and program this using
        Javascript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML as part of a four-person team.

        Between larger projects, I'm currently developing a series of browser-based minigames in HTML5 and Javascript.
        The goal is to start small and push the limits of Javascript in terms of graphics, gameplay complexity and
        user interface to test how far it can take us.  Our first minigame is near completion, with several more planned,
        including a port of the original Blockhead.

      My next web project will add a news section to this portfolio site, allowing me to log in, post, and save entries
      without having to touch any HTML or source code.  I'm planning to use the Angular framework, authentication tokens,
      and Mongo for database management.
