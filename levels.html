    As an experienced mapmaker, I've worked on over one-hundred new maps and environments
    for various games, including Doom, Quake 2, Quake 3, Half-Life, and Team Fortress
    Classic.  My work has included single player, deathmatch, and team-based
    multiplayer maps in various time and place settings and art styles.  I've displayed
    here some of my more recent work that best showcases my talents.

        Evolver Source is a partial conversion of Half-Life 2 into an area from Evolver,
        a future game idea we've been working on.  For this project I've created not only
        the geometry but all of the wall textures myself.  I'm producing the content on
        a modular basis and the next add-ons planned are for a new weapon design and a new
        creature.

        The Arena is a gladiator-style pit used for bloody deathmatches.  Each combatant
        spawns into a holding cell with one weapon and select items for balance.  A
        switch in the cell raises the gate to the arena, and begins a fight for survival.

        The Sewage Treatment Plant emphasizes stealth and strategy over typical
        running-and-shooting deathmatch tactics.  The map has lots of armor and  mostly
        light-to-medium weapons that make one-shot kills difficult, and features plenty of
        small hiding spots and tight corners for ambushes and quick escapes.  For those who
        explore there's a quad damage hidden in a pipe near the top of the building, but
        they'll have to fall three floors into a vat of raw sewage to get it.
