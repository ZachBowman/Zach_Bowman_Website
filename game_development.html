        Aside from a few XBOX-specific code snippets, everything in Blockhead was programmed
        entirely on my own, from the animations to the game logic to the menu screens.
        Blockhead is the most comprehensive showcase of my game development talents thus far.

        <div class = "stripe2">Particle System</div><br>
        <br>
        One of the most useful graphical tools I built for Blockhead is a comprehensive 2D
        particle system.  I've used the functions to realistically simulate almost anything,
        including fire, steam, smoke, fireworks, laser beams and explosions just by tweaking the
        values and supplying a few images as a base.  The programmer can adjust the amount, speed,
        direction, spread, transparency, and fade speed of the individual particles, and
        define preset effects to be used as shortcuts.  It was programmed in C#
        for XNA Game Studio, and can be easily ported to most other platforms.<br>
        <br>
        The particle engine has already gotten some significant upgrades as I implement it into
        my new adventure game, Boxland.  Since the game engine keeps track of the world in 3D,
        the particles now fly around inside the world, interacting with it's architecture and
        objects, rather than just drawn on top of it.

      </div>

        The Boxland engine represents the first evolutionary step in a new game engine I'm building from scratch.
        On the surface, the game is tile-based and from a 2D overhead perspective, but the game world is actually
        running in 3D.  All of the surfaces are kept track of in terms of brushes and textures (like an early Quake
        or Half-Life engine), and the characters and objects have three-dimensional locations and physics.<br>
        <br>
        The advantage to creating my own gameplay engine is that I will be able to create environments that are not
        only completely destructible, but with a level of detail and interactivity that we have rarely seen in
        games before.  Subsequent projects built on this code will include 3D graphics, map editor compatibility,
        and support for any game style, from first-person shooter to role-playing.

    <div class = "stripe2">Dreamscape</div><br>
    <br>
    Closely tied to the game engine outlined above is a companion tool called Dreamscape.
    Dreamscape will be a map editor that will allow the designer to incorporate randomly
    generated elements into the game's design, creating an experience that changes each
    time a new game is started; the ultimate in replay value.  This first version features
    game-created details would such as randomly placed enemies, lights and wall decals. 
    Subsequent versions will be complex enough to randomly generate complete areas of the
    game world using parameters set by the developer.  Eventually, my goal is to achieve a
    system in which large portions of the game are created by the game itself.  In essence,
    we would be teaching a game how to make new games.
