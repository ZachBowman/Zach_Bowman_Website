        Blockhead is a two-dimensional puzzle game in the vein of Kirbee's Avalanche or
        Dr. Mario.  One of the important gameplay decisions I made was to include an
        optional countdown timer, which can change the game into either a methodical,
        thinking game or an anxious race based on the player's preference.

        My current project, Boxland, is a hybrid puzzle / action / adventure game.  The
        player freely explores the labyrinth of a large factory searching for keys to unlock
        new areas.  Players will need to be both clever and creative to collect keys since
        most puzzles will have multiple solutions.  At the same time they will also have to
        battle the game's enemies using melee and projectile weapons.</font>

      Sometimes it's the little things that elevate a good game to great game status.
      The specific rules and systems that govern a game's experience often contribute
      the most to what makes it addictive and unique.

        Blockhead is the first puzzle game to use color blending as a primary tool.  The
        goal is to get three of the same colored blocks in a row, but the player can also
        change a block's color.  If a red block is placed touching a blue block, for
        example, the blue block turns purple.  This creates the possibility for chains
        of block destruction and block avalanches.

        In Boxland, the player gains different superpowers granted by various magical
        sweatshirts, which he uses to move objects and solve puzzles.  The shirts are
        also equipped with specialized attack moves for combat situations.  The different
        types of boxes and machines in the game respond differently to both the player
        and the environment, creating the possibility for interesting interactions and
        complex puzzles.

        The story and characters are some of the most important elements in medium to
        large-sized games.  I've been writing creative fiction both in and out
        of games for almost twenty years.  I specialize in science-fiction, horror, and
        cartoon humor, but I've also worked on comic books, black comedy, and folk tales.
